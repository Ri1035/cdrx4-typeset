'==========================================================
'  Build TypesetToolkit.gms from the VBA sources in src\
'
'  Requires CorelDRAW X4 (with VBA) installed on this machine.
'
'  Steps:
'    0. get CorelDRAW out of the way (see below)
'    1. copy an unprotected GMS shipped with X4 as a seed
'    2. drop its components and import every module in src\
'    3. write the startup handler into ThisDocument
'    4. save as TypesetToolkit.gms in the X4 user GMS folder
'    5. run M_Test.Probe / Diag / SelfTest and M_Install.DiagToolbar
'
'  WHY CORELDRAW IS RESTARTED FIRST
'  X4 auto-loads every GMS under User Draw\GMS at startup, so a running
'  instance already holds TypesetToolkit.gms in memory.  Building into that
'  project means inheriting its component names, and the old M_Install --
'  which sits on a compile error -- refuses to be removed.  VBE then
'  quietly renames the fresh import to "M_Install1", every
'  M_Install.<Proc> macro path stops resolving, and the startup handler
'  dies with -2147220224 ("module not found").  So the file is swapped
'  while no instance is running, and X4 is then started fresh.
'
'  src\*.bas are stored as UTF-8 so they read well on GitHub,
'  but VBE imports ANSI text, so every file is re-encoded to a
'  GBK temp copy before import.
'
'  This script is ASCII-only on purpose: Windows Script Host
'  reads .vbs as ANSI, so a UTF-8 file containing Chinese
'  literals would be mis-parsed (and can even break the quotes).

'   --hook=<file>   read the ThisDocument startup code from <file>
'                   (UTF-8).  A file whose first non-blank text is
'                   --none, or an empty file, means "no hook at all".
'                   Without this flag src\_startup.txt is used, and that
'                   file says --none -- i.e. the default is no hook.
'   --nocheck       skip the in-session Probe/Diag/SelfTest run and
'                   just save the GMS.  Used when the point of the
'                   build is to launch CorelDRAW by hand afterwards.
'
'   The hook lives in a file rather than being hardcoded here because
'   it is the one piece of code that would run INSIDE CorelDRAW's start
'   callback.  v1.0.2 had one and it crashed X4 on every launch; keeping
'   it in a file that says --none is what makes "no hook" the default,
'   and what makes a hook variant testable by launching X4 for real.
